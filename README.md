- Gained employee trust.

## Steps followed:

[Download the dataset from here](https://github.com/MansiAgrawal26/HR_Analytics_Dashboard_PowerBI/blob/master/HR_Analytics%20Dataset.csv)

**1. Data Gathering:** 
  - Importing raw data .csv file into Power BI & transform to Power Query editor for cleaning and data processing.
          
**2. Data cleaning:**
  - Cleaning is done by removing empty column, removing duplicates, errors etc.
  - Replacing values in column with proper values and naming.
  - Detecting data type of every column, using the auto detect data type function in Power query editor.
          
**3. Data processing:**
  - In the Power Query editor, creating new column called "AttritionCount" by using conditional column feature in add column which is created on the basis of certain condition like (IF attrition = 'Yes' then 1, Else 0).
  - This new column is further used for creating different KPI's and charts.Then creating the Attrition Rate by applying DAX queries, adding new measure (Attrition Rate = SUM([AttritionCount]))/SUM([Employeecount])) in %.
          
**4. Data analysis:**
  - Analysis involves the creation of a range of visual representations, including bar charts, key performance indicators (KPIs), table charts, pie charts, and other relevant visualizations.
  - These tools are utilized to gain insights and present data in a comprehensive and easily understandable manner.

### Key Questions of the Dashboard :

    What is the Total Employee Count ?
    What is the employee's Average Age & Average Salary ?
    What is the Attrition Count of men and women ?
    What is employees Working years at the Company ?
    Which Department has maximum employee ?
    What is the Gender distribution ?
    Which Education Field has maximum employees ?
    Which Business Travel has maximum employees ?

### Learned about:
1. Calculated Field: To Calculate Attrition Rate & Active Employees
2. Matrix table: To show Job Satisfaction rating
3. Donut chart and Pie Chart
4. Bar Chart and Cluster chart ðŸ“Š
5. KPI(Key Performing Indicators) and Slicer.
6. Filters: Used to filter data according to gender

### Key Insights Summary:
1. **Total Employees:** The organization has grown significantly, currently employing 1470 individuals, indicating substantial growth and scale.
